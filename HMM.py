        '''
        Initializes an HMM. Assumes the following:
            - States and observations are integers starting from 0. 
            - There is a start state (see notes on A_start below). There
              is no integer associated with the start state, only
              probabilities in the vector A_start.
            - There is no end state. 

        Arguments:
            A:          Transition matrix with dimensions L x L.
                        The (i, j)^th element is the probability of
                        transitioning from state i to state j. Note that
                        this does not include the starting probabilities.

            O:          Observation matrix with dimensions L x D.
                        The (i, j)^th element is the probability of
                        emitting observation j given state i.

        Parameters:
            L:          Number of states.

            D:          Number of observations.
            
            A:          The transition matrix.
            
            O:          The observation matrix.
            
            A_start:    Starting transition probabilities. The i^th element
                        is the probability of transitioning from the start
                        state to state i. For simplicity, we assume that
                        this distribution is uniform.
